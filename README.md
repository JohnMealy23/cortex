# cortex
A JavaScript project that will...
 * Build a hierarchical network of mutually-aware nodes from a single node: http://screencast.com/t/TjXXKEkHw.
 * Pass data up, down, and sideways throughout the hierarchy.
 * Save previously undetected patterns.
 * Recognize when newly input patterns correlate to previously input patterns.
 * Recognize like patterns, as well as similar but not like patterns.
