A JavaScript project that will...
 * Build a hierarchical network of mutually-aware nodes from a single node.
 * Pass data up, down, and sideways throughout the hierarchy.
 * Save previously undetected patterns.
 * Recognize when newly input patterns correlate to previously input patterns.
 * Recognize similar but not like patterns.
